# Odin's Landing Page Project

This is a project from **The Odin Project** which consists in making a _landing page_ using **flexbox**. 

## About the project:

* Odin has given a layout to follow, however, the person can style it as they want, so I chose to style my page as a Ghibli's movie "Howl's Moving Castle" page.
* The page has an header with navigation bar with some links, the movie's summary, a picture of it, plus a button that redirects for the Netflix page, where the movie is now available to watch.
* The page also has a section to show the main characters with a short description of them.
* A quote section with a quote of the character _"Sophie"_.
* A call to action that leads the user to watch the movie on Netflix.
* And a footer section.
